        <h2>Exercise 1: Running</h2>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>1. Warm-Up: Start with a 5-10 minute warm-up to prepare your muscles and joints. This can include walking, light jogging, and dynamic stretches (leg swings, arm circles).</p>
        <p>2. Proper Running Form:
            Posture: Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and look ahead rather than down at your feet.
            Arms: Keep your arms bent at about a 90-degree angle and swing them naturally with your stride.
            Feet: Land midfoot and roll through to the toes, avoiding heavy heel striking.</p>
        <p>3. Start Slowly: If you're new to running, start with a combination of walking and running. For example, run for 1 minute and walk for 2 minutes, gradually increasing the running intervals as your fitness improves.</p><br/>
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>To begin running, ensure you have appropriate footwear and start with a warm-up, such as brisk walking or dynamic stretches. Maintain proper formâ€”keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and arms swinging naturally as you run. Aim for a conversational pace to avoid overexertion, and gradually increase your running duration or intensity over time. Stay hydrated throughout your run and cool down with a slow walk and static stretches afterward. Listen to your body and adjust as needed to prevent injury and maximize the cardiovascular benefits of running.</p><br/>

        <h2>Exercise 2: Treadmill</h2>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>1. Setting Up the Treadmill:
              Adjust Settings: Familiarize yourself with the treadmill controls. Adjust the incline and speed settings to start at a comfortable level.
              Safety Key: Attach the safety key to your clothing. This will stop the treadmill if you fall or need to stop quickly.</p>
        <p>2. Starting the Workout:
              Warm-Up: Begin with a 5-10 minute warm-up at a slow walking pace (2-3 mph) to prepare your muscles and joints for more intense activity.
              Posture: Stand up straight with your shoulders back and head facing forward. Keep your arms relaxed and bent at a 90-degree angle, swinging naturally with your stride.</p>
        <p>3. Running/Walking
              Increase Speed Gradually: Gradually increase the speed to your desired pace. For walking, this might be 3-4 mph. For running, you might increase to 5-7 mph depending on your fitness level.
              Maintain Proper Form: Keep a natural stride and avoid leaning too far forward or back. Land on the middle of your foot and roll through to your toes.</p><br/>
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>To start a treadmill workout, set the machine to a comfortable speed and incline. Begin with a 5-10 minute warm-up at a slow pace. Gradually increase the speed for running or walking intervals, maintaining proper form. Adjust the incline for added intensity and use intervals to vary the workout. Cool down with a slow walk and follow up with static stretches. Ensure to stay hydrated and listen to your body to avoid overexertion.</p><br/>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>1.Proper Form: Maintain a relaxed posture with feet together, elbows close to your sides, and wrists relaxed. Jump just high enough to clear the rope and land softly on the balls of your feet.</p>
        <p>2.Timing and Rhythm: Time your jumps so the rope passes under your feet as you land. Start slowly to establish rhythm, then gradually increase speed while maintaining control.</p>
        <p>3.Consistent Practice: Regularly dedicate time to practicing jumping rope to improve your technique, endurance, and coordination. Start with shorter sessions and gradually increase duration as you progress.</p><br/>
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>To perform a jump rope workout, start with a 5-minute warm-up of light jumping or dynamic stretches. Jump rope for 10 minutes, varying your pace and technique to keep it engaging. Finish with a 5-minute cool down, including stretching exercises to relax your muscles.</p><br/>
